Webpack, a module bundler, solves a significant problem for web developers. It can be daunting to learn but once you grok it, life gets easier. Same goes for React, a JavaScript library for building UIs. This book shows you how to build a little Kanban application using these technologies. During the process you will learn the basics and will be able to take the skills to your own projects.

## How to Use This Repository?

The repository has been split in two main parts: `manuscript` and `project_source`. You can find the book in its entirety under `manuscript` organized per chapter. `project_source` contains source associated to each chapter.

There is no single right way to approach the book. It depends on your experience level and interest. You can build the project from scratch by following the book or you can start from a specific stage. Just pick the source from previous chapter as your starting point.
